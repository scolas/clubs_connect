# clubs_connect
Help people find and join new clubs

The purpose of this application is two-fold:

1. People who run clubs on college campuses will be able to add their club. This gives them a way provide more
information about their club, promote membership and communicate with members

2. People will be able to find clubs they wish to join and follow them. This will allow them to communicate with other members via the
chat and see any upcoming events on the schedule
